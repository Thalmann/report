The Decentralized Label Model \cite{myers1997, myers1998, myers2000} is a method of ensuring information flow control in a system.
This is done by annotating the source code with security policies, in the form of labels attached to data-holding constructs.
This section will present the necessary information needed to understand the first implementation of our flow-checking tool.
The descriptions and definitions in this section are based on \cite{myers1997, myers1998, myers2000}, but only relevant parts will be presented now.
